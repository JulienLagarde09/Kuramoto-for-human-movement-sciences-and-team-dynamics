A short note: Sometimes the order parameter of Y Kuramoto is presented as two "order parameters" (wikipedia pages for instance),
which is wrong. The physical interpretation, the meaning, of this order parameter, is both phase-coherence and mean angle.
This is given by a single complex variable. This correponds to first and second moment of the distribution of the phases of the ensemble oscillators.

get a data set of phases Subjects X time point drawn from a Gaussian distribution
 wrapped to +-pi (von Mises would be better);
compute the variables on this data set,
varying the variance of the distributions as in different "trials" (for loop dstb)
Output: Correlation between Kuramoto's order param (dispersion) and Richardson variable = 1
